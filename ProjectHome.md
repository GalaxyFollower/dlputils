A selection of utilities, written in Fortran, designed for use with molecular dynamics trajectories generated by DL\_POLY 2 and 3.  These codes are provided in good faith as a basis for your own codes, or for you to use / modify / fix at will.  As such there is no guarantee that they are fit for purpose (although I have been using them without issue for many years), no guarantee that they are free from bugs, and user support is minimal.  Use at your own risk!
